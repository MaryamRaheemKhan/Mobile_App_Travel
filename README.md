## Tech Stack

- **React Native**: A framework for building mobile apps using JavaScript and React.
- **TypeScript**: For static type checking, enhancing development with fewer bugs.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for fast UI styling.
- **Expo**: A framework for building React Native apps, providing a rich set of development tools.
- **EAS Build**: For building React Native apps in the cloud.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for discovering travel destinations.
- Lists of popular food places at each travel location.
- Seamless navigation between pages and interactive features.
- Integration of Tailwind CSS for a responsive and clean UI.
